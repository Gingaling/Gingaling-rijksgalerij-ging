# Rijksgalerij-GING (deployed at)

This front-end application exhibits Dutch masterpieces held by the Rijksgalerij, or Rijks Museum, located in Amsterdam. A user can perform a search of the museum holdings if s/he has a favored Dutch artist.

It was built with React and React-Bootstrap.

This began as a bootcamp assignment that was created by my really wonderful and in-the-stratosphere-smart instructor, [Esin Saribudak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esinsaribudak/). I recently decided to revisit some of my old assignments (some of which were optional so sadly were never completed) to see what I thought of them now that I am several months out from completing the bootcamp. I also didn't think it would hurt to have a refresher on things, like Bootstrap.

This was actually one of the assignments I skipped. It was one of several "choose your own React adventure" and I had chosen a different one. So I spent a good chunk of the day completing this project. It was fun. It was also nice to be able to do it at a leisurely pace and really dig deep on understanding certain features of React and Bootstrap. After completing the project, I spent a little more time with styling. I also added a feature where the user can enter the number of desired search results.
