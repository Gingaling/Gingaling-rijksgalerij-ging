# Rijksgalerij-GING
(deployed at https://strong-licorice-0b4b3e.netlify.app)

This front-end application exhibits Dutch and international masterpieces held by Amsterdam's Rijksgalerij (or Rijks Museum), using the institution's [API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/
). A user can perform a search of the museum holdings if s/he has a favored Dutch artist as well as indicate the desired number of results to be returned from the search. The actual number of results found will also be displayed. In addition, there is functionality to learn more about each individual piece of art.

This API was built with React, React-Bootstrap and CSS. It was deployed using netlify.

This API had its genesis as a software engineering bootcamp assignment that was created by my really wonderful and in-the-stratosphere-smart instructor, [Esin Saribudak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esinsaribudak/). I recently decided to revisit some of my old assignments (some of which were optional so sadly were never completed) to see what I thought of them now that I am several months out from completing the bootcamp. I also didn't think it would hurt to have a refresher on things, like Bootstrap.

This was actually one of the assignments I skipped. It was one of several "choose your own React adventure" and I had chosen a different one. So I spent a chunk of the day completing this project, adding additional functionality, and playing with the CSS. It was fun. It was also nice to be able to do it at a leisurely pace and really dig deep on understanding some features of React and Bootstrap. After completing the project, I spent a little more time with styling. I also added a feature where the user can enter the number of desired search results. I also added a feature where the actual number of search hits appears.
